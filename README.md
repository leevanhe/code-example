This code is a demonstration of my skills with the Vue.js framework. It showcases how I apply best practices in building dynamic, responsive front-end applications using modern JavaScript. Throughout the example, you'll find clear structure, reusable components, state management, and a focus on maintainable, scalable code. Additionally, I've incorporated TypeScript to enhance the reliability and type safety of the project.

The project highlights my ability to create intuitive user interfaces, manage complex states, and integrate APIs, reflecting my proficiency in Vue's core functionalities.
